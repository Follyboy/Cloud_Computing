# Flower-Image-Classifier-with-Amazon-Sagemaker (with PyTorch)


PROJECT DESCRIPTION: A classifier that distinguishes a flower into 102 different species given the image of a particular flower

This project was done as a class project for Cloud Computing Class.  PyTorch version 0.4.1 was used in this project.

The project involved applying transfer learning to develop an image classifier for 102 different flower species. A ResNet152 pre-trained model was used in the training.

The dataset was divided into a training set, validation set and a test set. A validation accuracy was calculated as the training progressed and a final test accuracy of 90% was obtained on a separate test data.

The training was carried out on Amazon Sagemaker.
